## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
```
## Ensure dplyr and tidyr are installed.

```
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```
## Ensure dplyr and tidry have been called.

```
setwd("INSERT YOUR DIRECTORY FILEPATH HERE")
```
## Set the working directory to the folder of choice, which contains the relevant raw data files provided for this project.


## Assign tbl_df names and import the relevant text files into R Studio converted to tbl_df format. 
```
test_data <-tbl_df(read.table("X_test.txt"))
train_data <-tbl_df(read.table("X_train.txt"))
test_labels <-tbl_df(read.table("Y_test.txt"))
train_labels <-tbl_df(read.table("Y_train.txt"))
activities <-tbl_df(read.table("activity_labels.txt"))
variable_names <-tbl_df(read.table("features.txt"))
test_subject <-tbl_df(read.table("subject_test.txt"))
train_subject <-tbl_df(read.table("subject_train.txt"))
```

## Bind the testing and training rows for the subjects, labels, and data, respectively.
```
subjects <-bind_rows(test_subject, train_subject)
labels <-bind_rows(test_labels, train_labels)
data <-bind_rows(test_data, train_data)
```

##Change the variable names of subjects, labels, and data, respectively.
```
colnames(subjects)[1]<-"Subject"
colnames(labels)[1]<-"Activity"
variable_names<-variable_names$V2
```

##Remove the first column of "variable_names" which is unnecessary.
```
variable_names <-as.character(variable_names)
```

##Change the format of "variable_names" to characters, so it can replace the column names of "data".
```
colnames(data)[1:561]<-variable_names
```

##Combine subejcts, labels, and data to create the full dataset.
```
fulldata <- bind_cols(subjects, labels, data)
```


##use dplyr chain to select the correct features (only means and standard deviations), group by subject and activity, and compute group averages
```
final_data<-fulldata%>%
  select(matches('Subject|Activity|mean|std'), -contains("angle"))%>%
  group_by(Subject, Activity)%>%
  summarize_all(funs(mean))
```

##Change activity names from numbers to words.
```
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="1"] <- "WALKING"
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="2"] <- "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="3"] <- "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="4"] <- "SITTING"
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="5"] <- "STANDING"
final_data$Activity[final_data$Activity =="6"] <- "LAYING"
```


##save final data as tidy1.txt
```
write.table(final_data, "tidy1.txt", row.names = F, quote = F)
```
