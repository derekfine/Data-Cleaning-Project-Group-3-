### Introduction
Our group had two tasks: Task 1 and Task 2. In order to accomplish Task 1, we used the human activity recognition using smartphone's data set to practice harmonizing, merging and cleaning a messy dataset. Similarly for Task 2, we used a data set related to decomposing electric power plant emissions to practice cleaning, transforming and partitioning data. All of the code and files relating to these exercises can be found in the /data-cleaning-project-group-3-/ repository.

#### Before You Get Started
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")

#### The repository includes the following files:
- *CodeBook.md* : contains the final code for Task 1 and Task 2
- *README.md* 
- **Task 1** folder
  - *Cleaning1.Rmd* : Markdown file with code for Task 1 with accompanying notes referencing steps taken and the contributions of team members.
  - *tidy1.txt* : A concise dataset derived from the main dataset, which was built using separate .txt files provided for this exercise.

- **Task 2** folder 
 - *Cleaning2.r*: an r script file containing the code and annotated steps for cleaning the Task 2 data
  - *tidy2.txt*: a text file containing the cleaned data for Task 2
  - *tidy2_a.txt*: a text file containing a table of variable averages for each plant across all years
  - *tidy2_b.txt*: a text file containing a table of variable aggregates of all plants for each year
